# Redesigning Democracy

## I get it

We’ve been doing this for a long time. And in the era where this concept first occurred, we were not at all as connected as we are today. We needed the fellow from our town, community, county to speak our words for us. The thing is: we don’t anymore.

In a society driven by profit and rapid changes, I keep asking myself: why do we vote for individuals when all else is data-driven? Can you imagine voting for a **cause**, purely for that cause, not for a party, a leader, or empty promises?

## What if

What if we had polls that made politicians who truly burn for a cause help accomplish it? Not for fame, fortune, popularity, or power, but for that **specific cause**. Can you imagine?

Obviously, we’ve all seen it in every election: the promises that never lead anywhere, the shifts in morals, the human error.

## Vote for causes, not people

So, can you imagine not having to read up about a specific party or member, but voting for **cases**—real life. What’s really important to you, to us?

Can you imagine the terror it would inflict on those leaders, knowing that it’s not about them—it’s about the people?

## Choosing what matters most

Imagine, instead of feeling like you have to choose between the lesser of two evils, you could choose what’s important: healthcare, education, loans, pensions, immigration. Can you imagine that? Taking a poll and trusting in actual democracy?

## Data-driven decisions

Businesses have been doing this for a long time—testing the waters, making decisions based on their target group with **real data**. Why aren’t we, as a society, doing the same? We are the board, and we are the ones who should make the decisions, not the people making dangerous deals behind closed doors.

## The collective solution

Can a single individual really carry the needs of an entire state? What if we, as members of the board, chose groups of people to solve our problems? And if they can’t, let someone else try. We don’t want profit. We want to be heard. We want justice. We want change. And honestly, if the system weren’t as broken as it is, we would know how to get it.

Can you imagine that?
